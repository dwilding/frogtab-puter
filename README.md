Demo of self-hosted Frogtab with Puter sync.

To get started:

 1. Open [puter.com](https://puter.com/).

 2. At the top-right of Puter, click ⚠️ (Save Account).

 3. Enter a username, your email & password, then click **Create Account**.

 4. Open Frogtab at [dwilding.github.io/frogtab-puter/](https://dwilding.github.io/frogtab-puter/).

    A popup will ask you to authorize Puter.

 5. In the popup, click **Continue**.

    A Puter login window will open.

 6. In the Puter login window, click your username.

You have successfully logged in to Puter! Frogtab will use your Puter account to sync data between devices.

> **NOTE:** Frogtab does not encrypt your data before sending it to Puter.

To log in on another device, start by opening [puter.com](https://puter.com/).
This time click the user icon at the top-right of Puter and select **Add Existing Account**.
You can then open Frogtab at [dwilding.github.io/frogtab-puter/](https://dwilding.github.io/frogtab-puter/).
When you authorize Puter and select your username, you might see a second username.
The second username is a temporary Puter account that you can safely ignore (you can remove it at [puter.com](https://puter.com/) if you like).
